5. Use a loop to count the occurrences of a specific item in an array.

Exercise 5: Looping Over Objects

1. Create an object with key-value pairs representing student names and their scores.
2. Use a for...in loop to print each student's name and score.
3. Calculate the average score of the students in the object.
4. Find the student with the highest score using a for...in loop.
5. Modify the object to include a new student and score.

Exercise 6: Looping with Break and Continue

1. Create a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but skips the number 5 using continue.
2. Use a loop to search for a specific element in an array and break when found.
3. Create a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 20 but breaks when a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
4. Use a loop to find and print the first prime number greater than 10.
5. Create a loop that finds the smallest number in an array but stops if it's less than 5.

Exercise 7: Looping with Do-While

1. Create a do-while loop that counts from 1 to 5.
2. Modify the loop to execute at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

Exercise 9: Looping with For...In (Objects)

1. Create an object with key-value pairs representing book titles and their authors.
2. Use a for...in loop to print each book title and author.
3. Calculate the total number of books in the object.
4. Find and print books written by a specific author using for...in.
5. Modify the object to include new book titles and authors.

Exercise 10: Looping with Map, Filter, and Reduce
