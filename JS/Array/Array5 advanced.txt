1. Create two arrays with overlapping elements.
2. Find the intersection of the two arrays (common elements) using `filter()`.
3. Find the union of the two arrays (combined elements) using `concat()` and `filter()`.
4. Find elements unique to each array (difference) using `filter()`.
5. Sort the union array using `sort()`.

Exercise 47: Array Sum and Product (Advanced)
1. Create an array of numbers.
2. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the array using `reduce()`.
3. Calculate the product of all numbers in the array using `reduce()`.
4. Use `reduce()` to find the maximum number in the array.
5. Use `reduce()` to find the minimum number in the array.

Exercise 48: Array Transformation with `map()` (Advanced)
1. Create an array of strings containing numbers.
2. Use `map()` to convert the strings to actual numbers.
3. Use another `map()` to square each number.
4. Create a new array containing the square roots of the squared numbers.
5. Calculate the average of the squared roots using `reduce()` and `map()`.

Exercise 49: Array Splitting and Joining (Advanced)
1. Create a string of sentences separated by periods.
2. Split the string into an array of sentences using `split()`.
3. Use `join()` to concatenate the sentences into a single string separated by line breaks.
4. Split the string again using a different delimiter (e.g., "###").
5. Join the split string back together with spaces and periods.

Exercise 50: Array Deduplication (Advanced)
1. Create an array with duplicate elements, including nested arrays and objects.
2. Remove duplicates to create a new array with unique elements.
3. Maintain the original order of elements while removing duplicates.
4. Use a custom function and `filter()` to deduplicate the array.
5. Compare the performance of the custom function with using `Set` for deduplication.

Exercise 51: Array Pagination (Advanced)
1. Create an array of items.
2. Implement pagination by displaying a specific number of items per page.
3. Create functions to navigate to the next and previous pages.
4. Display the current page number and total pages dynamically.
5. Handle edge cases like navigating beyond the available pages and updating the UI accordingly.

Exercise 52: Array Sorting with Custom Logic (Advanced)
1. Create an array of objects representing products (with name, price, and category).
2. Sort the products based on price in ascending order using `sort()`.
3. Implement a custom sorting function to sort products by category and then by name.
4. Sort the products in descending order of price using `sort()`.
5. Compare the performance of sorting using a custom function and `sort()`.

Exercise 53: Array Transformation with `reduce()` (Advanced)
1. Create an array of objects representing transactions (with type, amount, and date).
2. Use `reduce()` to group transactions by type into an object.
3. Calculate the total amount for each transaction type.
4. Find the transaction type with the highest total amount.
5. Calculate the average transaction amount for each type and add it to the grouped data.

Exercise 54: Array Searching and Filtering with Multiple Criteria (Advanced)
1. Create an array of objects representing products (with name, price, category, and stock status).
2. Filter products based on multiple criteria, such as price and category.
3. Implement a search function to find products by name or keyword.
4. Create a filter function to find products with low stock or out of stock.
5. Combine multiple filtering conditions to create advanced search and filter functionality.

Exercise 55: Array Transformation with `flatMap()` (Advanced)
1. Create an array of sentences.
2. Use the `flatMap()` method to split each sentence into words.
3. Filter out common stop words (e.g., "the," "and," "is") from the words.
4. Count the frequency of each remaining word in the array.
5. Create a histogram of word frequencies, sorted by frequency count.
